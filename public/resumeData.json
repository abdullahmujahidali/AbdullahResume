    "bio": "Hi there! My name is Abdullah Mujahid! You might also know me as Addy Paladin. I've been coding for over 5 years now. I am An Associate Software Engineer at Carte Blanche. Other than that I am  also a researcher who loves to explore and learn more about Artifical Intelligence, recently I wrote an article on Hand Gesture Recognition using Yolo v3 which is published at MDPI. Along the journey I realised my passion existed in helping others excel and pursue their dreams as upcoming developers. With this passion, I have learned a number of programming languages.",
